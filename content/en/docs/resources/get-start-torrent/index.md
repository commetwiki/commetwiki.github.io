lead: "<b>Torrent</b> is a type of file-sharing technology that enables peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing over the internet. It is commonly used to download large files and content such as movies, music, software, and games. Torrents work by breaking down a large file into smaller parts, which are then shared among multiple users in a peer-to-peer network. This allows for faster download speeds and increased reliability as files can be downloaded simultaneously from multiple sources instead of relying on a single server."
