### Contributions we welcome

#### Logo Design

We invite talented artists and designers within our community to contribute their creative vision by designing a logo that encapsulates the essence of our educational resource-sharing mission. The logo should reflect our commitment to unity, growth, and access to knowledge. Submissions can be posted in the designated logo design room in our Matrix Space.

#### Uploaders

The backbone of our community is formed by dedicated uploaders who generously share their educational materials. If you have lecture notes, study guides, textbooks, or any other valuable learning resources, we encourage you to upload and share them with the community. Your contributions directly impact the education of countless individuals.
  
**Verified uploaders are featured on our [Uploaders]({{< relref "uploaders" >}}) page along with the links to their profiles on torrent sites.**

#### Seeders

Seeders play a crucial role in ensuring the availability and accessibility of shared materials. By seeding, you contribute to the longevity of resources and maintain the availability of content for future learners. This selfless act of supporting the community helps sustain our mission.  

#### Other members

Those who do not want to upload but have access to some valuable learning resources that are not already available or partially available on the torrent sites can share the resources with uploaders for them to upload. More info and the "how-to" can be found on our matrix community.

### Contribute to the wiki

Every page in this wiki has a link to edit the page, if you think you have found a problem on the page you're reading, go to the link which redirects you to the source file in github repo of this site, make changes and issue a pull request.  
  
You can go even further and add new pages in the wiki if you wish to. Here's the [link](https://github.com/commet-wiki/commet-wiki.github.io) to the github repo of our site. In case you don't know how to fork a github repo and make changes, we'll soon add a tutorial in Resource Section of our wiki.  
  
**Currently we have added nothing in the Resources Section of our wiki, this section is supposed to contain learning resources, tools etc related to torrents, privacy, the internet or anything else that could be useful for uploaders or seeders, or members falling into any category, and the community as a whole. If you consider adding new content to the wiki, our suggestion would be to keep this section your priority. Though any type of contribution is welcomed.**

#### Blogs

We welcome you to share your knowledge and experience with us and write a blog for our wiki. You can add your blog page in our [Github](https://github.com/commet-wiki/commet-wiki.github.io) or just submit it to us in the blog submission room in our Matrix.
