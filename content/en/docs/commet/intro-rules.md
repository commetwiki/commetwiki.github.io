## Welcome to the COMMET: Sharing Knowledge, Breaking Barriers!

COMMET, Community for Educational Torrents, is a dynamic, grassroots  
educational community. Our mission is as clear as the day: Empower  
students and knowledge-seekers alike by creating an ecosystem where  
learning materials flow freely like a river of wisdom. Making it  
possible with the power of torrents.<br><br><br>

### What do we intend to be?

As already said "A community for educational torrents", that's it then?  
  
No, don't skip this section already. The major intention behind creating COMMET was to get more people (more like...motivate?) into uploading educational content onto the major torrent sites because, at the time of writing this post (and if there are many such uploaders while you're reading this then I guess we were successful or at least let's assume this community played at least a small part in this), there's barely anyone uploading courses that are meant to be for university students or maybe even high school students, which with itself brings the need for the availability of courses for competitive exams as well (which are as well barely available, especially these courses actually). Here's a little bit of [reference](https://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Want-to-make-a-community-for-educational-torrents) how it all started.  
  
So, let's see how it goes. It doesn't mean we intend to have only uploaders in COMMET. It's no community without variety. Not just for the sake of variety, we welcome seeders, who don't upload (may as well) but help the content reach more people by giving a share of their valuable bandwidth or resources; true heroes (not exaggerated tbh) and an integral part of the system.  And people who are interested in accessing the torrents only. Could be students, teachers, or anyone. Or whether you just stumbled upon this wiki randomly out of curiosity. Everyone's warmly welcomed. Even the members who do not wish to upload or seed can help the community as well,  by sharing content with those in the community who wish to upload and thus making it recheable to more people. I have explained it in the [Contribute]({{< relref "contribute" >}}) page as well. And Here's how you can [Join]({{< relref "how-to-join" >}}), in case you didn't find the links already.

### Our ideology

We believe that knowledge and information should flow freely without any constraints, such as economic background or anything of that sort. And those who are buying. Thank you; you are doing a great job as well. Long story short, we are not against anyone, but we are on the side of knowledge-seekers. And knowledge and information should flow freely, as I said.

If you do not support this ideology, I welcome you. If you do, I welcome you.
<br><br><br>

### Rules:

Like every organized community, we do have some rules that I hope the members will follow. These apply to everyone, from a general member to the founder.  
  
1. **You are not allowed to share any type of content for the exchange of money or anything equivalent to it. This will get you banned instantly, without any warning. The buyer won't be punished, though.**

2. **Doxxing any member of the community will not be tolerated. You are supposed to respect everyone's privacy. Not following this rule will obviously get you banned without a warning.**

3. **No NSFW content. You will be warned twice before getting banned.**
  
<br><br><br><br>
This wiki page is a collaborative effort, and its content will evolve over time based on the contributions and needs of the community.
