##### Currently, we are on two platforms where you can interact with other members:

1. [Discord](https://discord.gg/SBjZcbVKkz)
2. [Matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/!ZUcQYrEZXbiXFdiEoT:matrix.org?via=matrix.org)

That's it! By joining, you agree to follow the community rules mentioned on this [page]({{< relref "intro-rules" >}}). So, make sure you have read the rules.

##### Who should join?

I have already explained it well in the [Introduction page]({{< relref "intro-rules" >}}), I believe. But if you are running short of time, here's a bit about it (though I believe you should read the Introduction page thoroughly at least once before joining):

Anyone who wishes to upload or who already uploads educational torrents. Anyone, could just be a student who is just interested in accessing such torrents, a seeder who seeks to help the community, someone who wants to interact with other members or uploaders to request content or for any other reason, someone who found a dead torrent from our community and wishes someone else who has it to seed it, or someone who is just curious about such torrents or our COMMET.
