### Who should join?

I have already explained it well in the [Introduction page]({{< relref "intro-rules" >}}), I believe. But if you are running short of time, here's a bit about it (though I believe you should read the Introduction page thoroughly at least once before joining):

Anyone who wishes to upload or who already uploads educational torrents. Anyone, could just be a student who is just interested in accessing such torrents, a seeder who seeks to help the community, someone who wants to interact with other members or uploaders to request content or for any other reason, someone who found a dead torrent from our community and wishes someone else who has it to seed it, or someone who is just curious about such torrents or about COMMET.
