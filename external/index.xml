You are not allowed to share any type of content for the exchange of money or anything equivalent to it. This will get you banned instantly, without any warning. The buyer won&amp;rsquo;t be punished, though.
Respect the privacy of other members
Doxxing any member of the community will not be tolerated. You are supposed to respect everyone&amp;rsquo;s privacy. Not following this rule will obviously get you banned without a warning.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://commetwiki.github.io/external/groups/fcem/about/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2023 16:46:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://commetwiki.github.io/external/groups/fcem/about/</guid><description>FCEM is a Telegram community dedicated to sharing educational materials for free using the power of torrents.
